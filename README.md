# Python Projects Collection

A curated collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python projects created
to practice and demonstrate core programming concepts such as control flow,
data structures, functions, file handling, and basic automation.

Each project is organized in its own folder with a dedicated `README.md`
explaining its functionality, features, and concepts used.

This repository represents consistent practice and progressive improvement
in Python fundamentals.
